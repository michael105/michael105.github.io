  Blog of Rob Landley. Nice to read. 



It might have been in 1994, when I got known the first demos.
My PC (a Cyrix M1) was hardly able to play videos.
And I was fascinated by the moving pictures. 
"Second Reality" has been the demo, I've been running over and over.
Since I started programming with gwbasic in 1990, I also realized, 
in how genius the hackers have been, realizing such animations at the quite restricted hardware back then.

  Nice and interesting blog of Rob Landley. (Founder of toybox, related with busybox, and so on.)
	Have to read further there, it's more a biography than a blog.

-> [https://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/](https://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/)  -  Mainly about BSD. Seems Nice.


-> [https://unix4lyfe.org/xterm/](https://unix4lyfe.org/xterm/)  
		 
		 About configuring xterm - and about the alternatives.
		Same conclusion as me. Most terminal emulators are nothing else than bloated xxxxx just.
		Essentially I really do not get, why every single distribution I touched, 
		did have misconfigured xterm to the ugliest. Overall, it's the most mature, stable, and resourcefriendly terminal 
		emulation of all.

-> [Youtube: nice clip about tiling window managers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKviflL9XeI)
  I guess I'll give i3 a try.
